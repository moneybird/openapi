The `send_method` attribute on [contacts](/api/contacts) has been replaced by the `delivery_method` attribute. The possible values are also slightly different:

`Email`
:   Send invoices to contact via email.

`Post`
:   Send invoices to contact via postal system.

`Manual`
:   Just mark invoices send to contact as sent.
