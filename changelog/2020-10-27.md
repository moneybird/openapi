* We've added new filter options `created_after` and `updated_after` in the [`GET /sales_invoices`](/api/sales_invoices/#get_sales_invoices) and the [`GET /sales_invoices/synchronization`](/api/sales_invoices/#get_sales_invoices_synchronization) endpoint. It is now possible to retrieve sales invoices created or updated after a given timestamp.
