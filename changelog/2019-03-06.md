On April 3th a change to the api will be made.
* When creating a new contact without specifying a value for `email_ubl`, the email UBL attachment setting from the administration will be used instead of a default value of `true`. The value for sending UBL attachment can be set in Moneybird via `Settings > Simplerinvoicing & UBL > UBL as e-mail attachment`. By default this value is set to `true`.
