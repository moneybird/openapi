We've extended the functionality of webhooks by adding the possibility to subscribe to events. You can now choose
which events you would like to recieve a notification from, by adding an array with the names of the events to the data. See [webhooks](http://developer.moneybird.com/webhooks) for more information.

If you decide to not subscribe to any events the old implementation will be used (notifications after state changes of sales invoices). This is to prevent existing webhooks from failing.
