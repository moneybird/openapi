* Sales invoices and estimates are now only visible for the recipient when they provide an public view code. If you use the API to point your clients to their invoices online using the `url` field, you should also provide the public view code for security. New sales invoices and estimates now return a `public_view_code` in the API payload. For old sales invoices and estimates, clients can use the invoice or estimate id to view the document.
