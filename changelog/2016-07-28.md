* All entities that belong to a specific administration now return their `administration_id` field in API responses.
* The [contact list](/api/contacts/#get_contacts) now returns the documented 100 contacts, instead of 50.
* Documentation has been improved for [SalesInvoice](/api/sales_invoices/#get_sales_invoices) and [Estimate](/api/estimates/#get_estimates) filtering.
* [Deleting a contact](/api/contacts/#delete_contacts_id) will now return a `422` HTTP code when deleting failed. Deleting can fail when a contact is still used within the bookkeeping.
