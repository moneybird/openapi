We have extended the API with an endpoint for [import mappings](/api/import_mappings). With the move from the old MoneyBird to the new MoneyBird, all ids of entities in an administration have changed. Some API developers might have saved old ids in their database. In order for them to keep querying our API with the right ids, we have added an API for the import mappings. By querying the import mapping API, you can transform old ids to new ids in the new MoneyBird. This should be a one-time conversion, the import mapping endpoint will not be indefinitely available.

Old ids can be recognized as plain autoincrement ids, usually not larger than 1.000.000. The ids in the new MoneyBird are no longer autoincrement ids, but are defined based on the time of generation in our database. The ids are therefore much longer, an example of a new id is `111433428396672003`. Make sure your application can handle these large numbers, sometimes this requires a change to your database structure or changes in JavaScript.
