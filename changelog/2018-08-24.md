On October 24th some changes to the api will be made.
* When making a recurring sales invoice or an estimate, it is possible to enter a workflow via the ‘workflow_id’ field. If this field is not entered, the default workflow from the administration will be used. This is inconsistent with the behaviour on our website and app, there the default invoice- and estimate-workflow of the contact will be chosen first. If the contact doesn’t have a default workflow, the default workflow from the administration will be chosen after all. To make consistent behaviour, we will also implement this behavior in the API.
* Recently we added a public view code to your sales invoices and estimates. Sales invoices end estimates are only visible for the recipient when they provide this code. So far the use of this code was not needed for invoices and estimates created by the API, but this will change. If you use the API to point you clients to their invoices using the ‘url’ field, you should also provide the public view code for security. New sales invoices and estimates return a ‘public_view_code’ in the API payload. For old sales invoices and estimates, clients can use the invoice or estimate id.
