We've added an `/estimates` endpoint to manage estimates. It includes all functions from the old API, and several new ones. It has been developed to be consistent with `/sales_invoices`. [Read more in the estimates API documentation](/api/estimates/).

A `due_date` attribute has been added to sales invoices. This attribute also exists for estimates.
