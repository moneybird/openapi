When creating a [sales_invoice](/api/sales_invoices) without giving a workflow id, MoneyBird will try to find a default invoice id saved at the contact first before using the administration default. 


It's no longer possible to use the `email` attribute when creating or updating [contacts](/api/contacts). You'll need to use the `send_invoices_to_email` and `send_estimates_to_email` attributes instead.

It's no longer possible to use the `attention` attribute when creating or updating [contacts](/api/contacts). You'll need to use the `send_invoices_to_attention` and `send_estimates_to_attention` attributes instead.
