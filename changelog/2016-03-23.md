* [Documents](/api/documents_purchase_invoices/#get_documents_purchase_invoices_id) now include a nested representation of the contact they're atttached to.
* The `events` attribute was added to a lot of entities. These events represent the history items shown in the MoneyBird web interface. For example, an event containing `action: sales_invoice_send_email` will tell you the time at which an invoice was sent by email and to whom it was sent.
