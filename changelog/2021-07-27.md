We introduced two new fields for products:

- `identifier`: a unique identifier for your products, for example for productnumbers or SKU codes. When products have an identifier, you can find them using the new endpoint: `GET /products/identifier/:identifier`.
- `title`: an extra title for products besides their `description`. Used in the new checkout feature.
