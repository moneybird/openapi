* The 'delivery_method' `Post` for the endpoint [`PATCH /sales_invoices/:id/send_invoice`](/api/sales_invoices/#patch_sales_invoices_id_send_invoice) is now deprecated. From 01-01-2023 forward it will no longer be available
* The field 'end_to_end_id' in the response of a `purchase_transaction` on the endpoint [`GET /purchase_transactions/get_purchase_transactions`](/api/purchase_transactions/#get_purchase_transactions) is now deprecated and will be replaced with the field `description`. As of now the 'description' field is available so you can make the transition if you use this field.
