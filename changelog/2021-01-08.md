* We've added a new filter endpoint for contacts. you can find these and the possible filter options at [`GET /contacts/filter`](/api/contacts/#get_contacts_filter)

* The [`GET /contacts/synchronization`](/api/contacts/#get_contacts_synchronization) endpoint also includes these filter options. You can filter on `created_after`, `updated_after`, `first_name` and `last_name`.
