* Deprecation of `events` in the Webhook API
  * The `events` attribute on webhook entities is considered deprecated and is replaced by `enabled_events`, starting January 1st 2025 `events` will be removed and will no longer be accepted.
  * POST requests `:administration_id/webhooks` now accept `enabled_events` instead of `events`.
  * GET requests `:administration_id/webhooks/:id` now return both `events` and `enabled_events`, until January 1st 2025.
* New endpoint `/contacts/:contact_id/moneybird_payments_mandate/url` to obtain a link that can be used to directly request a Moneybird Payments mandate for a contact.
