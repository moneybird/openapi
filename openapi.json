        "description": "Returns a paginated list of all estimates in the administration.\n\nThe `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of estimates. Filters are a combination of keys and values,\nseparated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:\n\n| **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `draft`, `open`, `late`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `billed` or `archived` |\n| period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |\n| contact_id | `Integer` | | Filters estimates by a single contact |\n| workflow_id | `Integer` | | Filters estimates by a single workflow |\n\nYou can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:draft|scheduled`.",

Filters are a combination of keys and values,\nseparated by a comma: `percentage:21,tax_rate_type:sales_invoice`. The available options for filtering are:\n\n| **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| name | `String` | | Select tax rates by their full name |\n| partial_name | `String` | | Select tax rates with this substring in their name |\n| percentage | `Integer` | | Select tax rates with the specified percentage, e.g. specify `21` for 21% |\n| tax_rate_type | `String` | `all` | `all`, `general_journal_document`, `purchase_invoice` or `sales_invoice` |\n| country | `String` | | Select tax rates with the specified country. Must be a 2 letter abbreviation following ISO 3166. Please note that only foreign tax rates will have this field set. Domestic tax rates will not have this set at the moment. |\n| show_tax | `Boolean` | | Use `true` to tax rates for which tax is shown on the invoice, `false` for when it's not shown. No value will select both |\n| active | `Boolean` | | Use `true` to select active tax rates. Use `false` for inactive tax rates. No value will select both |\n| created_after | `String` | | Tax rates created after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |\n| updated_after | `String` | | Tax rates updated after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |\n\nYou can filter by multiple tax rate types at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:purchase_invoice|sales_invoice`.",
