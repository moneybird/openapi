        Creates linear value changes that were not created yet.
        Use this if a new asset has just been created or if an arbitrary value change was created and the missing linear value changes need to be recalculated and recreated.
        This will create missing value changes for all months between the purchase date of the asset or the date of the last arbitrary value change and the last month of the administration.
        Requires a asset with a value change plan (so no assets that belong to a land or building category).
        Also requires that the asset has remaining value, has missing value changes at the end of some months and that all missing linear value changes are outside the locked period.
        This process will be performed asynchronously so no result will be returned. Use `Get /assets/:id` to check the result after a while.

        Returns a paginated list of documents of this type in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of documents. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

        Returns a paginated list of documents of this type in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of documents. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

        Returns a paginated list of documents of this type in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of documents. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

        Returns a paginated list of documents of this type in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of documents. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

        Returns a paginated list of documents of this type in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of documents. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of all estimates in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of estimates. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `draft`, `open`, `late`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `billed` or `archived` |
        | period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
        | contact_id | `Integer` | | Filters estimates by a single contact |
        | workflow_id | `Integer` | | Filters estimates by a single workflow |

        You can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:draft|scheduled`.

      summary: List all external invoices
      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of all sales invoices in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of external invoices. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `new`, `open`, `late`, or `paid` |
        | period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
        | contact_id | `Integer` | | Select invoices belonging to a certain contact |

        You can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:new|open`.

        Returns all financial mutations in the administration. The list contains the id and the version of the financial mutation.
        Check if the version of the financial mutation is newer than the version you have stored locally, use the `POST`
        variant for fetching financial mutations with the given ids. The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of financial mutations. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
          separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:

          | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
          | - | - | - | - |
          | period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,             `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
          | state | `String` | | Can be `all`, `unprocessed` or `processed`|
          | mutation_type | `String` | | Can be `all`, `debit` or `credit` |
          | financial_account_id | `String` | |

        Returns a list of financial mutations in the administration. Limited to 100 financial mutations. If you
        need more financial mutations, use the [synchronize](#get_financial_mutations_synchronization) API.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter on the list of financial mutations. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `key:value,key2:value2`. The most common filter method will be `period`: `period:this_month`.
        Filtering works the same as in the web application, for more advanced examples, change the filtering in the web
        application and learn from the resulting URI.

      summary: Creates a new ledger account
      description: |-
        The `account_type` determines the kind of ledger account, this can be any of the following values:
        `non_current_assets`, `current_assets`, `equity`, `provisions`, `non_current_liabilities`, `current_liabilities`, `revenue`, `direct_costs`, `expenses`, `other_income_expenses`

        By providing the `parent_id`, it is possible to create a tree of ledger accounts. Make sure the `account_types`
        of the parent and child equal.

        Returns a list of all purchase transactions in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of invoices. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:open`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `open`, `pending_payment`, `paid` or `cancelled` |
        | period | `String` | `nil` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
        | unbatched | `Boolean` | `true` | `true` or `false` |

        You can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:open|pending_payment`.

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | state | `String` | `active` | `active` or `inactive` |
        | frequency | `String` | `all` | `all`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter` or `year` |
        | auto_send | `Boolean` | `null` | `null`, `true` or `false` |
        | contact_id | `Integer` | | Filters recurring invoices by a single contact |
        | workflow_id | `Integer` | | Filters recurring invoices by a single workflow |

      summary: Creates a new recurring sales invoice
      description: |-
        A recurring sales invoice will create new sales invoices on set intervals. To create a new recurring sales invoice,
        you need to provide at least a contact and details for the invoice. Furthermore you need to determine the planning.
        The following fields will influence the planning:

        1. `invoice_date`: the date in which the first invoice should be created
        2. `frequency_type`: the type of frequency you want to use, for example `month`
        3. `frequency`: defines the actual frequency, e.g. `frequency=2` and `frequency_type=month` will create an invoice every 2 months
        4. `has_desired_count`: whether or not the desired count should take effect
        5. `desired_count`: maximum number of sales invoices to create

      description: |-
        This endpoint sends a reminder to a contact. A reminder can contain multiple sales invoices.
        Reminders are grouped by workflow, identity and document style, so a contact with sales invoices
        with different workflows, will receive multiple reminders. Only by grouping reminders like this, we
        can assure the right content and layout of a reminder.

      summary: Sends an invoice
      description: |-
        This endpoint provides two options: sending the invoice and scheduling sending in the future. When sending
        now, you can provide a send method, email address and message. If you don't provide any arguments, the defaults
        from the contact and workflow will be used.

        When scheduling sending, set the boolean `sending_scheduled` to true and provide an `invoice_date`.

      summary: List all invoices
      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of all sales invoices in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of invoices. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | - | - | - | - |
        | state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `draft`, `open`, `scheduled`, `pending_payment`, `late`, `reminded`, `paid` or `uncollectible` |
        | period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
        | reference | `String` | | Select invoices with a certain reference |
        | contact_id | `Integer` | | Select invoices belonging to a certain contact |
        | recurring_sales_invoice_id | `Integer` | | Select invoices created by a certain recurring invoice |
        | workflow_id | `Integer` | | Select invoices that use a certain workflow |
        | created_after | `String` | | Select invoices created after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |
        | updated_after | `String` | | Select invoices updated after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |

        You can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:draft|scheduled`. This also holds for the reference.

      summary: Create and schedule an invoice to be sent together with the subscription
      description: |-
        Besides the recurring sales invoice for the subscription, you sometimes need to bill
        separate costs like usage based charges. Ideally you want these costs to be on the
        same invoice as the subscription invoice. This endpoint allows you to put extra invoice
        details on the subscription invoice.

        This endpoint creates a new sales invoice and schedules it for sending on the same date as
        the next subscription invoice. During sending, Moneybird will merge both the scheduled invoice
        and the subscription invoice. This means the contact will receive one sales invoice with
        multiple invoice details, both from the subscription and from the one off sales invoice.

      summary: Create a new subscription
      description: |-
        Starts a new subscription for the given contact. The `product_id` points to a product with a frequency, price and description.
        A recurring sales invoice is automatically created to bill the contact for the given frequency. The first invoice will be sent on the
        start date, but no sooner than tomorrow. The `reference` will be added to the sales invoices.

        Optionally you can create a subscription with a different frequency than stored in the product. Make sure the frequency of the product
        and the provided frequency are compatible. E.g. you can bill a monthly product yearly.

      summary: List all available tax rates for the administration
      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of all available tax rates for the administration

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of tax rates. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `percentage:21,tax_rate_type:sales_invoice`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | name | `String` | | Select tax rates by their full name |
        | partial_name | `String` | | Select tax rates with this substring in their name |
        | percentage | `Integer` | | Select tax rates with the specified percentage, e.g. specify `21` for 21% |
        | tax_rate_type | `String` | `all` | `all`, `general_journal_document`, `purchase_invoice` or `sales_invoice` |
        | country | `String` | | Select tax rates with the specified country. Must be a 2 letter abbreviation following ISO 3166. Please note that only foreign tax rates will have this field set. Domestic tax rates will not have this set at the moment. |
        | show_tax | `Boolean` | | Use `true` to tax rates for which tax is shown on the invoice, `false` for when it's not shown. No value will select both |
        | active | `Boolean` | | Use `true` to select active tax rates. Use `false` for inactive tax rates. No value will select both |
        | created_after | `String` | | Tax rates created after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |
        | updated_after | `String` | | Tax rates updated after the given time (exclusive). ISO 8601 formatted string. The time to compare with is in UTC timezone |

        You can filter by multiple tax rate types at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:purchase_invoice|sales_invoice`.

        Returns a paginated list of all time entries in the administration.

        The `filter` argument allows you to filter the list of time entries. Filters are a combination of keys and values,
        separated by a comma: `period:this_year,state:all`. The available options for filtering are:

        | **Filter** | **Type** | **Default** | **Description** |

        | state | `String` | `all` | `all`, `open` or `non_billable` |
        | period | `String` | `this_year` | This can either be the description of a period (`this_month`, `prev_month`, `next_month`, `this_quarter`, `prev_quarter`, `next_quarter`, `this_year`,           `prev_year`, `next_year`) or a custom period (`201301..201302`, `20130101..20130131`) |
        | contact_id | `Integer` | | Select time entries belonging to a certain contact |
        | include_nil_contacts | `Boolean` | false | Whether to include time entries that have no assigned contact
        | include_active | `Boolean` | false | Whether to include active time entries i.e. time entries without ended_at
        | project_id | `Integer` | | Select time entries belonging to a certain project |
        | user_id | `Integer` | | Select time entries belonging to a certain user |
        | day | `Date` | | Select time entries on a specific date |

        You can filter by multiple states at the same time as well. To do this, separate the state values by a pipe: `state:open|non_billable`.

        Creates a new webhook. The provided URL should respond with a 200 HTTP status. After
        creation, the URL will receive notifications when events on documents in the
        administration occur. It is also possible to subscribe to certain events by adding an array
        with events you would like to receive notifications from.

        <p class="notice">
          <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
          We strongly recommend that you use a secure HTTPS endpoint for receiving payload from Moneybird.<br/>
          If you use unencrypted HTTP, anyone on the network may be able to listen in on sensitive information like contacts and invoices.
